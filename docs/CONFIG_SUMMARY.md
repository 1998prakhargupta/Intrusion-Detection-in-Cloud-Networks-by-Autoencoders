- **Features**:
  - Environment setup and dependency management
  - Code quality checks (format, lint, security)
  - Testing workflows (unit, integration, coverage)
  - Data and model management commands
  - Docker and Kubernetes deployment
  - Documentation building and serving
  - Monitoring and logging management

#### 11. **`.editorconfig`** - Editor Configuration
- **Purpose**: Consistent code formatting across editors
