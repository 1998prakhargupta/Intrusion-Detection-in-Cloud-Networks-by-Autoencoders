# This file ensures the logs directory is tracked by Git
# 
# The logs directory is essential for the NIDS application to store:
# - Training logs
# - Inference logs  
# - Performance monitoring logs
# - Error logs
# - Application runtime logs
#
# Even when empty, this directory structure should be maintained
# for proper application functionality.
