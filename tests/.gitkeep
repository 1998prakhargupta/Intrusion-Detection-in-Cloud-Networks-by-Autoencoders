# This file ensures the tests directory is tracked by Git
#
# The tests directory is essential for the NIDS project testing structure:
# - Unit tests for individual components
# - Integration tests for system workflows
# - End-to-end tests for complete functionality
# - Performance benchmarks
# - Security tests
# - Mock data and fixtures
#
# This directory structure should be maintained even when empty
# to support the testing framework and CI/CD pipelines.
