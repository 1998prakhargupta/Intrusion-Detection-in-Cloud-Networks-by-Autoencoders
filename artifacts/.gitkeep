# This directory contains model artifacts and outputs
#
# Purpose: Store trained models, checkpoints, and experiment artifacts
# Contents:
#   - Trained model files (.pkl, .pt, .h5)
#   - Training checkpoints and snapshots
#   - Experiment tracking artifacts
#   - Model export formats (ONNX, TensorRT)
#   - Model metadata and documentation
#
# Guidelines:
#   - Use version numbers in artifact names
#   - Include model metadata and performance metrics
#   - Compress large model files when possible
#   - Organize by experiment date or version
#   - Document model performance and usage
